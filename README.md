# PSAsyncShell
**PSAsyncShell** is an Asynchronous TCP Reverse Shell written in pure PowerShell. 

Unlike other reverse shells, all the communication and execution flow is done asynchronously, allowing to bypass some firewalls and some countermeasures against this kind of remote connections.

Additionally, this tool features command history, screen wiping, file uploading and downloading, information splitting through chunks and reverse Base64 URL encoded traffic.
